yarn build
```

## Usage

1. **Adding an Activity**  
   * Click the "Add Activity" button  
   * Enter the date, miles, calories, and weight (optional)  
   * Steps are automatically calculated based on your settings  
   * If an activity exists for the same day, values will be combined  
   * Click "Save Activity" to record

2. **Syncing Across Devices**  
   * Click the Settings button  
   * Find your sync code or enter a code from another device  
   * Click "Sync" to synchronize data  
   * Activities and settings will automatically sync in real-time

3. **Viewing Activities**  
   * Activities are displayed in chronological order  
   * Each activity shows miles, steps, calories, and weight  
   * Use the edit button to modify any activity  
   * Use the delete button to remove activities

4. **Viewing Summary**  
   * Toggle between weekly, monthly, and yearly views  
   * View total miles, steps, calories, and latest weight  
   * Toggle the average line on the chart for better visualization

5. **Settings**  
   * Click the settings icon to adjust steps per mile  
   * Changes automatically sync across devices  
   * Copy your sync code to pair with other devices

## Data Storage

Data is stored both locally and in the cloud:

* Local storage using browser's localStorage
* Cloud storage using Firebase Realtime Database
* Real-time synchronization between devices
* Automatic conflict resolution

## Privacy

* No user accounts required
* Data is only accessible with your sync code
